# Exius
Exius is a niche dockerized web api that allows users to make controlled web endpoints for uploading data. It was specifically built to handle uploads from insecure locations such as static, public websites that need a lot of specificity in what a client should be able to upload. 
The permission scope of Exius is tied to a github organization, and uses thegithub api to verify that users have access to whatever data they are attempting to modify. An organization admin could create the Exius system and then delegate creation of new endpoints (via git developer tokens) to those with access to the organization through specific git repositories. From that point, those with access to template keys would have access to only their data and then could delegate upload parameters (via creating template keys) that allow for clients to upload highly controlled formdata to an endpoint given in the template key. The client would then request a password protected write key based off the template key that was created earlier.
